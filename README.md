**Trainify** is a lightweight, premium-styled workout tracker designed for lifters who are tired of complicated apps and monthly subscriptions. It replaces your Notes app with a sleek, glassmorphism UI that tracks your routines, logs your lifts, and compares your stats against global benchmarks.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. **Plan Your Split 📝**
Create custom routines (e.g., "Push Day", "Leg Day (Pain)").
* **Dynamic:** Add as many exercises as you want.
* **Persistent:** Saves everything to Local Storage (no login required).

### 2. **Track the Gains 🏋️‍♂️**
Log your weights and reps in real-time.
* **Smart Inputs:** Prevents negative numbers (because negative gains aren't real).
* **Visual Feedback:** Smooth animations and clean layouts.

### 3. **The Analytics Dashboard 📊**
Visualize your progress with **Chart.js**.
* **Comparison Engine:** Compare your BMI, Duration, and Frequency against 900+ real gym members.

## 🧬 Gym Culture & Lore

We believe in the fundamentals:
1.  **Monday is International Chest Day.** (The code knows this).
2.  **Cardio?** We track it, but we don't have to like it.
3.  **The "Pre-Workout" Bug:** If the code crashes, it just needs more caffeine.
